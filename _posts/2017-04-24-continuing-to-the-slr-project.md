# :camera: Continuing to the SLR project... 

Added the aperture and shutter speed tables for ISO 1600 and 3200 but I can't go further until I solve the following:

* learning how to work with the i2c libraries for my [Nucleo](https://funlw65.github.io/my_nucleo_l152re/) board;
* porting the TSL2591 library to C language (in the same nucleo project).
