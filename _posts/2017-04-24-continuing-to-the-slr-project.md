# :camera: Continuing to the SLR project... 

Added the aperture and shutter speed tables for ISO 1600 and 3200 but I can't go further until I solve the following:

* learning how to work with the i2c libraries for my Nucleo board;
* porting the TSL2591 library to C language (in the same nucleo project).

You can go to the SLR project from the main page...

 Page done.
