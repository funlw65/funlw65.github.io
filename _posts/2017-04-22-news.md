# :star: First News :star:

Finally! I was able to set the site to provide multi-page and blog-like functionality, to install the emoji module and RSS feed (for the feed link, go to main page, at the very end).  :stuck_out_tongue:

The official documentation don't provide too much information and sometimes just refers to the official pages of jekyll engine, where you can't find github specific instructions. I mean, there is not an explicit tutorial that will help you to set the site as I was able to set it in the end, with much trial and error.

I use Pluma to edit the files on a Linux machine and the RapidSVN application to upload the changes. Yep, is a SVN client from the time when Google Code was still alive. Not much of a git guy...

```markdown
 Page done.
