## :boom: Welcome to my GitHub pages :boom:

Well, first of all, many thanks to the [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/) for providing one static web site for every github account - considering that the web hosting become expensive and ephemeral, this is great! And also, thank you for your visit!

What you will find here? Mainly, libraries I'm using in microcontroller programming. Here are few of them for AVR, PIC and STM32, for different C compilers. 

Then, some hardware - nothing special, just microcontroller development boards. 

There is an old project regarding a CMS site in PHP language, a fork of sNews Revolutions of Rui Mendes, to where I aded some code to make it SEF friendly and some more plugins - I didn't added it to the repository yet.

And recently I started working to a DIY SLR film camera, which can use also EOS compatible lenses - just the firmware for now, WIP.
